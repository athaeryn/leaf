# Leaf

Leaf keeps an eye on your git repositories. Before you leave your computer,
type `leaf` in the terminal, and leaf will let you know if there's anything you
might want to look at before you go. It will warn you about:

- Unpushed commits
- Unstaged changes
- Uncommitted changes
- Untracked files
- Repos with no remotes set

It was built to stop me leaving commits stranded on my work computer when I
left the office. It's like tying a bow on your finger, but more informative and
less damaging to your circulation.

When you run `leaf` in your terminal, it will give you a nice report of things
that might need your attention.

## Installation

Copy `leaf` to somewhere in your `$PATH`.

## Usage

All you need to do is run `leaf` whenever you want to know the status of your
repositories.
